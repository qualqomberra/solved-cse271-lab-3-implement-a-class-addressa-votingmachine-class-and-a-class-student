 <li>A house number, 2. A street, 3. an optional (positive &gt;0) apartment number, 4. City 5. a state 6. and an (positive &gt;0, 5 digit) integer zip code. Implement these in your class, along with getters and smart setters as shown in class. (6 points)</li>

</ol>

Supply two constructors: one that configures everything, and one for all but an apartment number. (2 points)

Supply a print method that prints the address with the street on one line, and the city; state; and zip code on the next line. (2 points)

Supply a method <em>public boolean comesBefore(Address other)</em> that tests whether this address comes before another when the addresses are compared by postal code. (2 points)

Part 2 (5 points)

Supply an appropriate (all variables) constructor (1 point)  Implement methods (4 points)

<ol>

 <li>getName()</li>

 <li>addQuiz(int score) . Score must be a positive integer from 0 to 100.</li>

 <li>getTotalScore()</li>
